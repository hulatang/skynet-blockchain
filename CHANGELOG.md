## 0.9.91 skynet-blockchain 2021-10-07

There was found a mempool bug that where some transactions wich could get stuck in mempool.

### Fixed

- Improved mempool validation (Fixed criticals in mempool_manager).

## 0.9.9 skynet-blockchain 2021-09-25

### Added

- Added random jolly block reward algo basen on block hash with x2, x5, x10 reward moltiplicator.

## 0.9.8 skynet-blockchain 2021-09-16

Today we’re releasing version 0.9.8 to address a resource bug with nodes, and we want to stress the importance of updating to it at the earliest convenience. The fix prevents a node from consuming excessive memory when many Bluebox Timelords are active on the chain.

### Changed

- Updated to BLS 1.0.6.
- Updates to the Rust conditions parser.
- Adjusted plot refresh parameter to improve plot loading times.

### Fixed

- Fixed memory utilization issue related to how the node handles compact VDFs generated from blueboxes. We recommend everyone update to this version to avoid memory issues that can impact farming and harvesting.
- Fixed issues with reloading plot files detected as bad (this can happen during plot copying).

## 0.9.7 skynet-blockchain 2021-09-02

### Changed

- Implement async_dns
- Use negative amount to indicate send in wallet get_transactions output.
- Plotting|util|tests: Fix and test re-trying of plots which failed to load.
- Random bluebox proofs.
- RPC updates to support keyring migration and passphrase requirements.
- Search for python newest to oldest.
- Fix type of FileKeyring.keyring_path.
- Calling SpendBundle.additions() or CoinSpend.additions() runs the CLVM program and parses the conditions outputs. It can be expensive and should not be done willy nilly.
- Break problematic dependency where the streamable infrastructure depends on Program, G1Element, G2Element and PrivateKey.
- Simplify the block_tools test facility.
- Make TestCostCalculation deterministic and check against a specific cost.

### Fixed

- Fixed errors in the GUI install script.

## 0.9.6 skynet-blockchain 2021-08-26

### Added

- Enable the rust condition checker unconditionally in testnet.
- Added support for multiple wallets.
- Added a change to config.yaml to tolerate fields that replace network constants in config.yaml that don't exist, but print warning.
- Improvements to sync full nodes faster by improving the concurrency for downloading and validating blocks.
- Added new call for logging peer_host: get_peer_logging that will use the peer_host value, typically an IP address, when the peername cannot be retrieved.
- Added documentation for treehash params.
- Added a py.typed file that allows other projects that pip install skynet-blockchain to type check using our functions with mypy.
- Added an RPC for coin records by multiple coin names.
- Enabled querying AAAA records for DNS Introducer.
- We now set the version for the GUI when doing a manual install using the install-gui.sh script. Uses a python helper to get the version of the skynet install and then converts it into proper npm format and puts that into package.json.
- Added some new class methods to the Program objects to improve ease of use.
- Added an option to sign bytes as well as UTF-8 strings, which is particularly helpful if you're writing Skynetlisp puzzles that require signatures and you want to test them without necessarily writing a whole python script for signing the relevant data.
- Added a first version of .pre-commit-config.yaml and applied the changes required by the following initial hooks in separate commits. To use this you need to install pre-commit, see <https://pre-commit.com/#installation/>.
- We have added many new translations in this release based on community
submissions. Thanks to @RuiZhe for Chinese, Traditional; @HansCZ for Czech;
@LUXDAD for English, Australia; @f00b4r for Finnish; @jimkoen, @ruvado for German; @Arielzikri for Hebrew; @A-Caccese for Italian; @Hodokami for Japanese; @LUXDAD for Latvian; @vaexperience for Lithuanian; @LUXDAD for Russian; @juands1644 for Spanish, Argentina; @MrDyngrak, @ordtrogen for Swedish; @richeyphu for Thai; @Ansugo, @baturman for Turkish.

### Changed

- Thanks @altendky for Correct * to ** kwargs unpacking in time_out_assert().
- Thanks @altendky for changing the default to paginate to skynet wallet get_transactions to address cases such as piping and output redirection to a file where the command previously just hung while waiting for the user to press c for the next page.
- Removed commented-out debug breakpoints.
- Enabled Rust condition checker to add the ability to parse the output conditions from a  generator program in Rust. It also validates some of the conditions in Rust.
- Switched IP address lookup to first use Skynet's service ip.skynet.net.
- Made changes so that when creating SSL certificate and private key files, we ensure that files are written with the proper file permissions.
- Define a new encrypted keyring format to be used to store keys, and which is optionally encrypted to a user-supplied passphrase. GUI for the passphrase will come in an upcoming release.
- Removed initial transaction freeze put in place at mainnet launch as it is no longer necessary.
- Separate locking and non-locking cases for get_confirmed_balance_for_wallet, which will allow calling a few wallet_state_manager methods while already under the wallet_state_manager lock, for example during DID wallet creation.
- Thanks to @Playwo for removing the index on coin_record spent column to speed up querying.
- Made a change to the conditions parser to either ignore or fail when it encounters unknown conditions. It also removes the UNKNOWN enum value from ConditionOpcodes.
- Renamed folder tests/core/types to tests/core/custom_types to address conflicts in debugger in PyCharm.
- Disabled DID wallet tests while DID wallet is under construction.
- Added pairing cache for faster aggregate signature verification.
- Added block height assertions after block farming.
- Added assertions for tx confirmation.

### Fixed

- Fix single coin generator.
- Fixed an issue with duplicate plotnft names.
- Fixed an issue during node shutdown in which some AttributeErrors could be thrown if the shutdown happens before the node fully started up.
- Fixed mempool TX cache cost, where the cost of the mempool TX cache (for spend bundles that can't be included in a block yet) would not be reset when the cache was emptied.
- Fixed a failure to create a keychain_proxy for local keychains.
- Thanks to @mgraczyk for fixing type annotation in sync_store.
- Thanks to @darkverbito for fixing an issue on initial creation of a coloured coin where code always falls into default else clause due to lack of type conversion.
- Fixed NPM publish in clvm_rs.
- Thanks to @skweee for his investigation work on fixing mempool TX cache cost, where the cost of the mempool TX cache (for spend bundles that can't be included in a block yet) would not be reset when the cache was emptied.

## 0.9.5 skynet-blockchain 2021-07-26

### Added

- Added ability to change payout instructions in the GUI.
- Added an option to revert to sequential read. There are some systems (primarily macos+exfat) where the parallel read features results in very long lookup times. This addition makes the parallel feature the default, but adds the ability to disable it and revert back to sequential reads.
- Added backwards compatibility for Coin Solutions in push_tx since renaming it to CoinSpend.
- Added an option to set the default constants on the simulator.
- Added a warning to user to not send money to the pool contract address.
- Added capability to enable use of a backup key in future, to claim funds that were sent to p2_singleton_puzzle_hash, which today are just ignored.
- Thanks @aarcro for adding timing metrics to plot check.
- Thanks @chadwick2143 for adding the ability to set the port to use for the harvester.
- Added more friendly error reporting for peername errors.
- We have added many new translations in this release.

### Changed

- Updated blspy to 1.0.5.
- Updated skynetpos to 1.0.4.
- Included all Skynetlisp files in source distribution.
- Removed left-over debug logging from test_wallet_pool_store.
- Made changes to allow us to use the name coin_spend everywhere in our code, without changing it in the API requests, both outgoing and incoming. Enables us to decide at a later date when to cut over completely to the coin_spend name.
- Thanks @mishan for your change to 'skynet plotnft show' to display Percent Successful Points.
- Thanks @Playwo for your change to make pool payout instructions case insensitive.
- GUI sees update when plots or harvesters change.
- Increased the cache interval to help large farmers.
- Removed proof limit for mainnet, but not testnet. This helps with pools that have very low difficulties. Thanks to @AlexSSD7 for pointing out the issue.
- We now also allow hex strings prefixed with 0x which is required because we currently prefix the strings in JSON conversion.
- Thanks to @opayen for your help in updating our MacOS icon.

### Fixed

- Thanks to @dfaranha for helping fix a parsing error in Relic inputs for BLS signatures.
- Fixed error type in wallet_blockchain.py.
- Thanks to @seraphik for a fix on our Linux installer that required root privileges.
- Thanks @felixbrucker for helping fix invalid content-type header issues in pool API requests.
- The wallet ignores coins sent by accident to the pool contract address and allows self pooling rewards to be claimed in this case.
- Thanks @mgraczyk for fixing the use of print_exc in farmer.
